tsla,"Fed's Powell emphasizes need for more evidence that inflation is easing before cutting ratesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday it will take a while for policymakers to evaluate the current state of inflation, keeping the timing of potential interest rate cuts uncertain.Speaking specifically about stronger-than-expected price pressures to start the year, the central bank leader said he and his fellow officials are in no rush to ease monetary policy.""On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,"" Powell said in remarks ahead of a question-and-answer session at Stanford University.""We do not expect that it will be appropriate to lower our policy rate until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward 2 percent,"" he added. ""Given the strength of the economy and progress on inflation so far, we have time to let the incoming data guide our decisions on policy.""The remarks come two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold benchmark short-term borrowing rates steady. In addition, the committee's post-meeting statement on March 20 included the ""greater confidence"" qualifier needed before cutting.Markets widely expect the FOMC to start easing policy this year, though they have had to recalibrate their outlook for the timing and extent of cuts as inflation has held stubbornly higher. Other economic variables, particularly in the labor market and consumer spending, have held up as well, giving the Fed time to assess the current state of affairs before moving.The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, showed a 12-month rate of 2.5% for February, or 2.8% for the pivotal core measure that excludes food and energy. Virtually all other inflation gauges show rates in excess of 3%.""Recent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected,"" Powell said. ""The recent data do not, however, materially change the overall picture, which continues to be one of solid growth, a strong but rebalancing labor market, and inflation moving down toward 2 percent on a sometimes bumpy path.""Other Fed officials speaking this week have made remarks consistent with the Fed's patient approach.Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC on Wednesday that he thinks just one cut might be in the offing as prices of some important items have turned higher. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said three cuts is a ""reasonable baseline"" but noted there are no guarantees, while Cleveland's Loretta Mester also said cuts are likely later this year while adding that rates over the longer term may be higher than anticipated. All three are FOMC voters.Powell reiterated that decisions are being made ""meeting by meeting"" and noted only that cuts are ""likely to be appropriate ... at some point this year.""The uncertainty about rates has caused some consternation in markets, with stocks falling sharply earlier this week as Treasury yields moved higher. The market stabilized Wednesday, but traders in the fed funds futures market again repriced their rate expectations, casting some doubt on a June cut as the market-implied probability moved to about 54% at one point, according to CME Group data.Along with his comments on rates, Powell spent some time discussing Fed independence.With the presidential election campaign heating up, Powell noted the importance of steering clear of political issues.""Our analysis is free from any personal or political bias, in service to the public,"" he said. ""We will not always get it right — no one does. But our decisions will always reflect our painstaking assessment of what is best for our economy in the medium and longer term — and nothing else.""He also talked about ""mission creep,"" specifically as it relates to some demand for the Fed to get involved in climate change issues and the preparations financial institutions take for related events.""We are not, nor do we seek to be, climate policymakers,"" he said.Correction: Powell's remarks come two weeks after the Federal Open Market Committee again voted to hold rates steady.

amzn,"Jeff Bezos Buys $90 Million Florida Mansion To Live In While His Other Newly Purchased $147 Million Homes Are 'Demolished' For A Mega MansionJeff Bezos, the world's second-richest individual with a net worth of $203.7 billion, has made significant real estate moves in Florida's exclusive Indian Creek Island, known colloquially as ""Billionaire Bunker.""Bezos's acquisition spree began with two mansions purchased for a combined total of $147 million. Not stopping there, Bezos recently added a third property to his collection for $90 million.The home, featuring six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, was acquired by Bezos through an off-market deal. Property records show the house was last sold in 1998,= for $2.5 million to banker Javier Holtz.Despite its luxurious attributes, the property's valuation by Zillow stands at approximately $41 million, significantly lower than the price Bezos agreed to pay for it. This discrepancy highlights the premium Bezos placed on the property, possibly because of its location, exclusivity or potential as a custom home site beyond the estimated market value.Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.Bezos’s latest property acquisitions are located next to the homes of Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner as well as the famed NFL quarterback Tom Brady. Situated in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the United States, Indian Creek is home to just 80 residences, each set in expansive mansions. These homeowners enjoy exclusive amenities, including a private golf course and country club, highlighting the area’s luxurious lifestyle.The latest reports from Bloomberg suggest an ambitious plan: Bezos intends to demolish the first two properties to make way for a massive mansion. However, this plan has not been officially confirmed by Bezos himself.Story continuesBeyond the sphere of luxury real estate, Bezos's relocation to Florida is strategically savvy, coinciding with selling approximately $8.5 billion worth of Amazon shares. Florida's tax environment, known for its absence of a state income tax, offers a significant tax advantage, particularly for high-net-worth individuals handling large transactions like Bezos.Bezos's latest real estate dealings and his decision to sell Amazon stock open a new chapter in his life, blending personal desires with a move to Florida, known for its favorable tax laws. His relocation to Miami, bringing him closer to family and his aerospace company Blue Origin, highlights a mix of reasons for the move, including personal, professional and tax-related benefits.While Bezos's real estate moves are out of reach for most people, getting into the real estate industry doesn't require millions.You can find opportunities to start investing in real estate with as little as $100 through this Bezos-backed company, real estate investment trusts (REITs) or crowdfunding websites, which offer a way for individuals to invest in property and real estate projects with minimal initial capital. These options provide a way for almost anyone to get a foot in the door of the real estate market, democratizing the ability to invest in this traditionally high-barrier industry.Read Next:Collecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler.
